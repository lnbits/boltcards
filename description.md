This extension enables you to link your Bolt Card to an NXP NTAG424 DNA tag via an LNbits hub. Each tap generates a new link, enhancing privacy and security compared to using a static LNURLw, which can also be written to an NFC tag (e.g., NTAG 213) in the withdraw-extension for purposes like one-time use gift cards.

For a simpler setup, you will need:

- An LNbits instance accessible over clearnet.
- Google Chrome browser opened on Android.
- Boltcard extension installed on your LNbits wallet.
- Boltcard NFC Card Creator App, available in the Apple or Play Store, to write your keys to the tags after they have been generated on LNbits.
